<h1>Modal</h1>
<p>
  This view controller was presented as a modal based on the path configuration file. Submitting this form will redirect back to the home screen. The native app will get receive that visit as <code>VisitProposal</code> and initiate a new visit.
</p>

<p>
  Notice that submitting the form will also cause it to dismiss the modal. That's handled by the demo app's router.
